		<h3><a name="activate">Activating the theme</a></h3>
		<hr />
		<p>There are 2 main ways to upload the theme:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Via the built in WordPress theme uploader</b>
		<p>Below you can read the instructions about installing a theme via the WordPress uploader, but you can also
		watch the "<i>Installing a Pexeto Theme via WordPress Uploader</i>" video <a href="http://support.pexeto.com/topic/video-4">here</a></p>
		<p>First you need to unzip the download file and find the zip file called "Anthology".
		After this you have to go in the admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Themes, click on the
		<b>Install Themes tab</b> and in this
		section in the top there is a link "Upload". After you click the "Upload" link, a new page
		will be opened where you will be asked to find the Anthology.zip file on your local
		file system. </p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Via FTP client</b>
			<p>Below you can read the instructions about installing a theme via FTP, but you can also
		watch the "<i>Installing a Pexeto Theme via FTP</i>" video <a href="http://support.pexeto.com/topic/video-4">here</a></p>
		<p>If you know the FTP login details of the server where your site is hosted and you have a
		FTP client installed, you might consider using this way of uploading your theme. First you have to
		unzip the download file, find the zip file called "Anthology", unzip it and upload the folder to the 
		main WordPress installation folder &raquo; wp-content &raquo; themes. Please note that if you 
		prefer this way of installation, you have to make sure that the main files of the theme are contained
		just within one folder of the <b>themes</b> folder. The right way to locate your root theme files is
		for example <b>themes/Anthology</b> but not <b>themes/Anthology/Anthology</b>.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p>After you have uploaded the theme to the server you will need to activate it.
		 In order to activate this theme you have to go to the admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Themes. In this section you should
  see the theme with a title <b>Anthology by Pexeto</b>. Just click on <b>Activate</b> button and your theme should get activated. </p>
	
	
	<div class="note_box"><b>Note: </b>This theme is WordPress version 3.0 and higher compatible, so please make sure
	you have the latest version of WordPress installed.</div>
	
	<p>
	<b><u>Importing the demo content</u></b><br/>
	If you would like to import the demo content and start editing the theme from the created content rather
	than from scratch, you need to import the <b>demo_exported.xml</b> file that is included with the download
	folder. You can do this by going to the WordPress admin panel -> Tools -> Import -> Select <b>WordPress</b>,
	 find the <b>demo_exported.xml</b> file from your local file system and upload it.
	</p>
	
	<br/>	
<hr />		
<h3><a name="options">Options page</a></h3>
<hr/>
<p>
When you activate this theme, an options page is created in order to help you make the theme settings
much easier. This page is located in the <b>admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Anthology Options</b>.
</p>
	<img src="images/options.jpg" alt="" />
	<br/><br/>	
<hr />
 
     <h3><a name="custom" >Setting a custom field</a></h3>
  <hr>   
        <p>Many times in this documentation you will be told that you need to set a custom field
        for a page or post. There are some custom field that have been created for this theme.
        Those custom fields are located just below the main content area of the page/post when
        opened in "edit" mode. For the portfolio items the section is called "ANTHOLOGY PORTFOLIO ITEM SETTINGS" and
        for the pages the section is called "ANTHOLOGY PAGE SETTINGS".</p>

        <h3><a name="thumbnail" >Setting a thumbnail to the post</a></h3>
  <hr>  
         <p>In order to set a thumbnail to a post, when creating/editing your post in the bottom of the right sidebar
  there is a link "Set Featured Image":<br/>
  <img src="images/set_thumbnail.jpg" /><br/>
  If you click on this link, a window will be opened where 
  you can choose the image. When you select the desired image, you have to click on the "Use as featured image"
  link.</p><br/>

        <a name="header" ><h2>The header<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>

		<h3><a name="logo">Changing the logo</a></h3>
		<hr />
        
        
    <img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        <p> You can either use your own existing logo image or edit the included logo PSD file. If you
    choose the second option then the file you need to edit is called <b>logo.psd</b></p>
    
  <p>There are two main ways to change your logo:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>From the admin panel- you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; <b>Styles</b> 
  and upload (or insert the image URL) in the <b>Logo Image</b> section. Please note that this setting won't be
  saved if you decide to move the theme to another WordPress installation.</li>
  <li>Replace the existing logo image with the new one- the image is called <b>logo.png</b> and is located
  within the <b>images</b> folder of the theme.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Once you have changed the image, you can also change the logo size in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; <b>Styles</b> 
  &raquo; <b>Logo Settings</b> section.</p>
  <br />
  <hr /><h3><a name="menu">The menu</a></h3>
		<hr /><img src="images/menu.jpg" alt="" /><br />
         
 
         <p>In WordPress version 3.0 a very nice feature for menu management has been added. Now
         you can very easily create custom menus with a great flexibility. In order to set the main menu
         in the header section you have to follow these steps:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>Go to Appearance &raquo; Menus and create a new menu. After you create the menu, you can
         add Page, Category and custom links from the left.
         <br/>
         <img src="images/custom_menu.jpg" />
         </li>
         <li>After that in the <b>Theme Locations</b> section you have to select the menu that you have created.
         <img src="images/select_menu.jpg" />
         </li>
         </ol>
        
  
  
 
    <br/>    
        
        
        <a name="footer" ><h2>The footer<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />
		
	
		
		<img src="images/footer.jpg" />
		<p>This theme supports a widgetized footer and you can insert whatever widgets you like in there. There
		are 4 different columns in the footer and each of them supports multiple widgets. </p>
		You just have to go to Appearance &raquo; Widgets and and drag and drop the desired widgets into the sections
		"Footer First Column", "Footer Second Column", "Footer Third Column" and "Footer Fourth Column". 
		<br/>
		
		<br />
		<a name="sidebar" ><h2>The sidebars<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />
		
		
		 <p>This theme supports multiple sidebars and they are all dynamic. This means that you can put whatever you want on them. </p>
  
  There are 4 sidebars that go with the theme by default:<br />
  <ul>
  <li>Blog Sidebar - a sidebar that is shown on the blog and on the posts from the blog</li>
  <li>Page Sidebar - a sidebar that is shown on the pages</li>
  <li>Home Sidebar - a sidebar that is shown on Featured page template</li>
  <li>Contact Sidebar - a sidebar that is shown on the contact page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you would like to have more sidebars than the default ones, then you can create your new sidebars in
  <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; Sidebars.</p>
  
  <p>
  To customize your sidebars you have to go in the admin panel &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Widgets. There you should see your sidebars on the right part of the page. Now you can drag and drop widgets from the left into your sidebars and that's it!<br />
  Here is an example of a sidebar:</p>

		<hr />	
		<h3><a name="thum_slider">Thumbnail Slider</a></h3>
		<hr />
		
		<p>The thumbnail slider looks like this:</p>
		<img src="images/slider.jpg" />
		
		<p>In order to add images to this slider you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page
		in the section <b>Thumbnail Slider</b>. All you have to do is to upload the selected image (or add its URL), link of the image
		(links can be set to the images, so that when the user clicks on the image to be redirected- this
		feature is optional) and description (also optional) and press
		the "Add Image" button. After you add the images, you can sort them by dragging and dropping the
		image box to the desired position.</p>

		slider.</p>
		
		<br/>
		<hr />	
		<h3><a name="big_thum_slider">Big Thumbnail Slider</a></h3>
		<hr />
		<p>The Big Thumbnail Slider looks and functions in the same way as the Thumbnail Slider and the only
		difference is that it is higher. It is ideal if you need to accentuate more on the images rather on the
		content below.</p>
		
			<p>In order to add images to this slider you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page
		in the section <b>Big Thumbnail Slider</b>. All you have to do is to upload the selected image (or add its URL), link of the image

		slider. If you would like to make the slider a fader (using only the Fade effect) you have to set the <b>Animation Effect</b>
		field to <b>Fade</b>.</p>
		
		<br/>
		<hr />
		<h3><a name="nivo_slider">Nivo Slider/Fader</a></h3>
		<hr />
		<p>The Nivo Slider looks like this:</p>
		<img src="images/nivo.jpg" />
		
			<p>In order to add images to this slider you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page
		in the section <b>Nivo Slider</b>. All you have to do is to upload the selected image (or add its URL), link of the image

		<a name="template" ><h2>Template Pages<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />
		<h3><a name="index">Index/Blog page</a></h3>
		<hr />
		
		
		<p>Index page is the default home page that is opened when first installing the theme. This page actually is a blog page. 
  </p>
  
  <p>There are 2 different ways of using this template:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>As a home page- it will be opened by default on your site.</li>
  <li>As a normal, non-home page. In order to do this you have to create a new page, lets say that
  its name is "Blog". After this you have to go in the Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Reading and you have to select "A static page" field. Below this field you have to 
  select the page which will be your home page in the "Front page" field and you have to select the 
  name of the page that you have just created (in our case "Blog") in the field "Posts page". Now
  your Blog page will contain the latest posts.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <b><u>Excluding categories from the blog:</u></b>
  <p>In order to exclude categories from the blog you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page in the
  section <b>Blog/Index &raquo; Post Settings &raquo; Exclude categories from blog</b>. In this section you have to check the names of the categories that you
  want to be excluded.</p>
  <img src="images/exclude_cat.jpg" />
  <br/><br/>
  
   <b><u>Defining the number of posts on the blog:</u></b>
  <p>In order to define the number of posts per page that will be shown on the blog you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page in the
  section <b>Blog/Index &raquo; Post Settings &raquo; Number of posts per page</b> and you have to edit the value of this field. Default is set to 5. 
  </p>
  
  
    <b><u>Selecting a slider for the page:</u></b>
  <p>In order to select a slider you have to go in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page in the section 
  <b>Blog/Index &raquo; Header Section Settings &raquo; Slider on posts/blog page</b>. In this field you can select between Thumbnail Slider, Big Thumbnail Slider, Nivo Slider/Fader and None.
   If None selected, then you can insert a title in the <b>Page Title</b> field below.</p>
  
  <img src="images/select_slider.jpg" />
  <br/><br/>
  
  <b><u>Selecting a layout for the page</u></b>
  <p>For the blog page you can select the layout to be Right Sidebar, Left Sidebar or Full Width. You can do this in the <b>Page Layout</b> section. This setting will affect also
  the blog post, archive and search layouts.</p>
  <img src="images/select_layout.jpg" />
  <br/><br/>
  
  <b><u>The blog sidebar:</u></b>
  <p>By default this page template uses the Blog Sidebar. If you would like to use another sidebar, you can create one
  in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; Sidebars and after that you can select the created sidebar in the field <b>Sidebar</b>
  in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; Blog/Index section. To customize it you have to go to the Appearance &raquo; Widgets and find the
  selected sidebar. You can drag and drop widgets from the left into it.</p>
  <br/>
    <b><u>Setting advanced blog pagination</u></b><br/>
    <img src="images/wp-pagenavi.jpg" />
    <p>In order to have advanced pagination enabled on your blog page (as on the screenshot above) you need
    to install the WP-Pagenavi plugin. You can read more about how to do it the section
    <a href="#widgets">Widgets Included</a>.</p>
  <br/>
  <b><u>The blog posts:</u></b>
  <p>The blog posts look like this:</p>
  <img src="images/post.jpg" />
  <br/><br/>
  
  <b><u>Setting a thumbnail/image to the blog posts:</u></b>
 <p>You can read <a href="#thumbnail">here</a> how to set thumbnails to your blog posts.</p>
  
   <b><u>Hiding part of the content of the post with the "Read More" link:</u></b>
   <p>Just before the text that you want to be hidden you have to click on the "Insert more tag" button (Alt+Shift+T):
   </p>
   <img src="images/more.jpg" /><br/><br/>
   
   <b><u>Enabling threaded comments (with reply functionality):</u></b>
 <p>In order to enable threaded comments, you have to go to <b>Settings &raquo; Discussion</b> and check the
 field "Enable threaded (nested) comments x levels deep"</p>
   
   
   
    
  <br />
  
  <hr/>
  <h3><a name="home">Home page</a></h3>
		<hr />
		
		
	<p>In order to make one page a home page you have to select the <b>Template</b> for this page to be <b>Home page</b>.
  If you want to set this page to be opened by default when a visitor first opens the site you have to go in the
  admin panel in Settings &raquo; Reading &raquo; Front page displays &raquo; Select a static page and select the page that 
  you have just created in the <b>Front Page</b> list.</p>
  <br />  
  <b><u>Setting the content of the home page</u></b><br />
  The content layout of the home page looks like this:<br /><br/>
  <img src="images/home_content.jpg" alt="" /><br />
  <p>Basically, the structure of the Home page template consists of 2 parts- the main content and the services boxes.
  The main content you can insert in the main content area of the page. If you would like to have the same intro as the
  one on the demo (and the screenshot above), you have to use the <b>intro</b> shortcode:</p>
  
  <pre name="code" class="html">
  [intro]Intro content goes here[/intro]
  </pre>
  
 <p>After that comes the services boxes section. In order to set the content and links to them you have to go to the 
 <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; Home Page and there for each of the 3 boxes you can set the content,
 icon and button settings.</p>	
  <br/>
  <b><u>Selecting a slider for the page</u></b>
  <p>In order to select a slider for the page, you have to set the <a href="#custom">custom field</a> <b>Slider</b> in the page.

  setting the <a href="#custom">custom field</a> <b>Page Layout</b>.</p>

  	<h3><a name="featured">Featured page</a></h3>
		<hr />
  	
  	<p>The main purpose of the Featured page template is to show some featured blog posts. This page
  	looks like this:</p>

  	<p>In order to make one page a featured posts page you have to select the <b>Template</b> for this page to be <b>Featured page</b></p>
  	
  	 <p>Above the Featured Posts section you can insert some intro content by inserting it in the main content
  	 area of the post. </p>
  
  <p>All the posts that that are shown below the main page content are posts from one category.
  So the posts that you need to be shown in this page should be set to belong to one "featured" category. To set the category whose posts will be
  shown you have to go to the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; General &raquo; Other and set the <b>Featured Category</b> field.

  <p>By default this page template uses the Home Sidebar. If you would like to use another sidebar, you can create one
  in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; Sidebars and after that you can set the <a href="#custom">custom field</a> <b>Sidebar</b>
  and select the sidebar that you have just created. To customize it you have to go to the Appearance &raquo; Widgets and find the
  selected sidebar. You can drag and drop widgets from the left into it.</p><br/>

		</div>
	
	
	<p>The purpose of this gallery is to insert multiple images at once - you can very quickly create multiple galleries just for
	several minutes.</p>
	
	<p><b>In order to create a quick gallery you have to:</b></p>

	  The contact form page looks like this:<br />
  <img src="images/contact.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />
  
  <p>This page contains an AJAX contact form and a separate contact sidebar.</p>
  <p> To make one page contain a contact form you have to do some settings. When you create (or edit)
  your page, you should find the field <b>Template</b> and in it to choose the <b>Contact form page</b> option. After that immediately your
  page will contain a contact form.</p>
  <p>To set a text in the contact page, just insert it as a content of the page.</p>
  <b><u>Setting the email address to which to send the email</u></b><br />

	<h3><a name="styles">Changing the theme style</a></h3>
		<hr />
		<p>All the style settings can be done in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> page &raquo; <b>Styles</b></p>
		<p>The theme goes with several predefined skins. You can change between those skins in the <b>Predefined Skins</b> section:
		</p>
		<img src="images/skins.jpg" alt="" />
	<br/>
		<p>If you would like to use another custom color, rather than one of the predefined colors, you can select
		your color in the <b>Custom Theme Color</b> field:</p>
		<img src="images/custom_color.jpg" alt="" />
		<br/>
		<p>If you would like to select a pattern for the theme, you can do it in the <b>Theme Pattern</b> section. Please
		note that a preview of the patterns in the drop down list (as shown on the screenshot below) is available only with
		Mozilla Firefox.</p>
		<img src="images/patterns.jpg" alt="" />
		<br/>
		
		<p>These are the main style settings that you can do on the theme. In this section (Styles section) there
		are many other custom settings that you might need to change such as text sizes, text colors, background colors, etc. </p>
		
		
		
		<br/>
		<a name="shortcodes" ><h2>Shortcodes<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />
		
		<p>This theme goes with 28 shortcodes. For a full reference of their usage and examples you can refer
		to the Features section of the <a href="http://pexeto.com/anthology_wp/">demo</a>. </p>
		<p>Using shortcodes is really easy- you just have to insert the shortcode in the main content area of the post/page.
		For example, if you would like to insert a button, you have to insert a content like this one:</p>
		
		<pre name="code" class="html">
		[button href="http://site.com"]Button text[/button]
		</pre>
		
		<b><u>Formatting buttons available from version 1.4</u></b><br/>
		
		<p>In version 1.4 of the theme, some formatting buttons have been included:</p>
		
		<img src="images/formatting_buttons.jpg" />
		
		<p>There are buttons for almost all of the styled elements that the theme provides. These buttons allow you
		to more easily insert styled elements and also you are able to see how they will look from the editor. 
		However, if you feel more comfortable with using raw shortcodes, you can do it - they are still available for you.</p>
		
		<br/>
		
		<b><u>Inserting Lighbox image</u></b>
		<p>There are different ways to insert a lightbox image (via the formatting buttons and the shortcodes), but
		the easiest way to set an image lightbox is to insert the image into the post (via the "Add an Image" button),
		after that click on the image -> an Edit Image button will be displayed. You have to click on this button,
		and in the window that is opened you have to click on the "Advanced Settings" section. In this section, in the
		field "Link rel" you have to insert the word <b>lightbox</b>. This automatically will set the lightbox functionality to the image.</p>
		
		
		
		<br/>
		<a name="translation" ><h2>Translation<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>
		<hr />	
	
	
	<p> For this theme I have provided the possibility to translate the built-in words from the admin panel, without having to
  edit the PHP files. You can do this in the <a href="#options">options setting</a> in the <b>Translation</b> section. For
  the contact form you have to edit the fields in the <b>Contact page</b> section.</p>
   <img src="images/translation.jpg" />
   
   <br/><br/>
   
   <br/>
		<a name="widgets" ><h2>Widgets included<a href="#toc" class="back_to_top"> &nbsp;back to top</a></h2></a>

   <li>Simple Google Map - displays a Google Map in the sidebar - downloaded from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-google-map/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-google-map/</a></li>
   </ul>
 
 <p>All the widgets are located within the <b>plugins</b> directory of the download folder. In order to activate them,
 you need to go to the WordPress admin panel -> Plugins -> Add New -> click on the <b>Upload</b> link and 
 find the desired plugin file on your local file system. After the plugin has been uploaded successfully you
 need to click on the <b>Activate</b> link. For the WP PageNavi plugin only activation is needed. For the other
 two you need to go to the <b>Widgets</b> section and drag and drop them to the desired sidebar.</p>

		<hr />

<b>Installing an update</b>
<p>There are two main ways of installing an update:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>By uploading the theme as a new theme</i>- this is an easier way to accomplish this. You just have to upload
the updated theme zip file via the built in WordPress theme uploader as a new theme as explained <a href="#activate">here</a>
and activate the theme. All the settings that you have made to the older theme will affect the new one.</li>
<li><i>Via FTP</i> - you can use an FTP client (such as FileZilla) and replace all the theme files with the
updated ones.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note_box">
		 <b>Note: </b>Please note that with the file replacing all the code changes you have made to the files 
		 (if you have made any) will be lost, so please
		 make sure you have a backup copy of the theme files before you do the replacement. All the settings that
		 you have made from the admin panel won't be lost- they will be still available.

		<hr />

		<p>In this section you can check the most common issues and the solutions for them</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><b>Portfolio thumbnail not generated</b>
		<p>Sometimes the image resizing script doesn't generate the image due to the following reasons:

		*functions/cache directory is not editable (777)<br/>
		*original image size is too big (more than 2000 pixels)<br/>
		*original image is not located within the WordPress installation directory

		</li>
		<li><b>Portfolio section does not exist in the main menu</b>
		<p>This theme is available for WordPress version 3.0 or higher, so please make sure you have the latest 
		version installed.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Appearance &raquo; Menus section does not exist</b>
		<p>This theme is available for WordPress version 3.0 or higher, so please make sure you have the latest 
		version installed.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Portfolio items not loading</b>
		<p>This issue is mostly likely to happen if you have uploaded the theme via an FTP client.
		 If so, you need to make sure that the main theme files are contained within just one directory of the <b>wp-themes</b>
		 directory, not more. For example for the style.css file it is correctly to be located within <b>http://site.com/wp-content/themes/Anthology/css/fonts.css</b>
		 but not <b>http://site.com/wp-content/themes/Anthology/Anthology/css/fonts.css</b></p>
		 <p>Another possible reason for this is that you haven't inserted some of the image/video URLs correctly.
		 So for images, please make sure you have set the image URLs and for videos please make sure you have inserted
		 correctly the video URLs. There are some examples of correct video URLs in the <a href="#portfolio_gallery">Portfolio Gallery</a>
		 section above.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Contact form not sending emails</b></li>
		<p>This issue is mostly likely to happen if you have uploaded the theme via an FTP client.
		 If so, you need to make sure that the main theme files are contained within just one directory of the <b>wp-themes</b>
		 directory, not more. For example for the style.css file it is correctly to be located within <b>http://site.com/wp-content/themes/Anthology/css/fonts.css</b>
		 but not <b>http://site.com/wp-content/themes/Anthology/Anthology/css/fonts.css</b></p>
		 <p>Also another reason for this issue is that the server where the theme is hosted has some restrictions set about
		 email sending.</p>
		 
		 
		 <li><b>Portfolio items not loading on Internet Explorer</b>
		 <p>This issue is most likely to happen if you have a broken image URL has been inserted. In this case, please make
		 sure that all the image URLs that you have inserted are URLs of existing images.</p>
		 </li>
		 
		 <li><b>In the Anthology Options Upload Button/Color Picker/Add Slider Image Functionality is not working</b>
		 <p>This is most likely to be caused by a plugin you have installed. You can try to deactivate all the plugins
		 you have installed and check if it will work. If it turns out that a plugin is causing this, you can deactivate
		 the plugin until you set the theme and activate it back once you are done.</p>
